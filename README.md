Here we have attached the complete code for the arduino Uno acting as slave.
 1) First those zip files have to be included in the Arduino, which can be done by sketch->include library->add .zip files
 2) Then run this code.
 3) Then in the browser 172.17.5.113 has to br typed
       password is:test
 4) For setting time to the slave arduino this format has to be followed         *hh.mm.ss
     Then setting alarm to the slave arduino this format has to be followed      hh.mm

  Only pending work in this slave is display of password on url.
Then RTC Battery has to be fixed.
